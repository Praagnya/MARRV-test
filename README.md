# MARRV-test

This repository serves as a testing project to experiment with and validate the functionality of a strategic planning agent (MetaThinkingAgent) built on top of transformer-based language models. It includes:
	•	Model loading and prompt-response generation
	•	Plan generation for math and logic problems
	•	Optional use of LoRA adapters for efficient fine-tuning
	•	Unit tests with pytest to verify core functionality

Ideal for:
	•	Prototyping LLM-powered reasoning agents
	•	Testing integration of PEFT models
	•	Exploring AI planning in health science or educational domains
